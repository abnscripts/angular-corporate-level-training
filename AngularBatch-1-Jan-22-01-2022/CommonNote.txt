Component
============
You build Angular applications with components. Components define areas of responsibility in the UI that let you reuse sets of UI functionality.

A component consists of three things:

1. A component class that handles data and functionality.
2. An HTML template that determines the UI.
3. Component-specific styles that define the look and feel.
4. component.spec file for unit testing

command to create a component
>> ng generate component componentName;
ShortCut
 >> ng g c componentName

For example:
>> ng g c registration
>> ng g c login
>> ng g c header
>> ng g c footer
